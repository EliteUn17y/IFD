# IFD
This plugin allows you to enable the item frame dupe (IFD) on your server. The plugin is based on SweetAnarchy's IFD plugin.

This plugin supports both spigot and paper servers.

## Options

The is only one option right now: `dupeChance`. This controls, between 0 and 100, how likely it is for the dupe to work. If it is set to zero or less, the dupe is not loaded at all to preserve resources. If it is set to more than 100, then the value is automatically set to 5, which is the defualt dupe chance on the SweetAnarchy server.
